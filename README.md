# Description - This is my first try on docker and docker compose. I used windows machine for this POC.

Steps -
1) Install docker on windows. Docker-compose gets installed with docker on windows. For linux, you will have to follow installation instructions separately.
2) On the docker's dashboard, click on learn and tutorial and follow the guidelines.
3) I tried docker compose to club mysql and nodejs app to render the app and store the data in mysql.
